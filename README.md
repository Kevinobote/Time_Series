## Project Overview
This project involves the application and comparison of different trading strategies on three major stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The strategies implemented include Moving Average (MA) Crossover, Bollinger Bands, and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Additionally, time series analysis and forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models are used to predict future stock prices and evaluate the performance of these trading strategies.

## Objectives
1. Apply and compare different trading strategies, including MA Crossover, Bollinger Bands, and RSI, to TSLA, MSFT, and NVDA stocks.
2. Utilize time series analysis and forecasting models (ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing) to predict future stock prices.
3. Provide empirical results and performance metrics for each strategy, highlighting their effectiveness and reliability.
4. Offer insights and recommendations for optimizing trading strategies using time series forecasting techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - yfinance
  - statsmodels
  - sklearn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

## Results
Results
The project provides a detailed analysis and comparison of the trading strategies applied to TSLA, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. Key findings include:

- The MA Crossover strategy demonstrated the highest final return of 535.92% for NVDA, with strong performance metrics across all stocks.
- The Bollinger Bands strategy showed mixed results, with a final return of 78.85% for MSFT but only 6.20% for TSLA.
- The RSI strategy had varied performance, with a negative return of -17.25% for TSLA but positive returns of 50.26% for MSFT and 60.67% for NVDA.

## Conclusion
The MA Crossover strategy emerged as the most consistent and effective strategy across all three stocks, delivering high returns and maintaining strong performance metrics. The Bollinger Bands and RSI strategies showed more variable performance, with the Bollinger Bands strategy being less reliable overall. The use of time series analysis and forecasting models can enhance the decision-making process in trading strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of stock price movements.
